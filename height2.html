    <!-- You will see that h-1/2 if applied alone without class h-screen on body so it will not work: h-1/2 works by setting the height to 50% of the parent container. If the parent element does not have a defined height, the h-1/2 will not have a reference point and will not apply correctly.jha pr body ki height khud 50% nhi ha viewport ki toh div uske andr ha uski kaise ho skti ha, so to resolve this ass class: h-screen to body. -->

<!-- Outer <div> (h-screen):

    This sets the height of the entire container to 100% of the viewport height.
    Inner <div> (bg-yellow-100 h-1/2):
    
    This sets the height of the yellow background <div> to 50% of its parent container (the outer <div>).
    Since the parent has h-screen (viewport height), this <div> will have a height of 50% of the viewport height.
    <h1> Element (bg-yellow-100 h-1/2):
    
    This sets the height of the <h1> element to 50% of its parent container, which is the yellow <div>.
    Since the parent <div> is 50% of the viewport height, the <h1> will have a height of 25% of the viewport height (50% of the parent). -->
